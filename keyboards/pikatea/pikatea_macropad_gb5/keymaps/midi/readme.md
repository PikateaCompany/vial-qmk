## Default Logic

Volume Down is set to clockwise (right) and Volume Up is set to counter clockwise (left).

## Flip Logic

To flip this set the keymap of KC_VOLU (Volume +) in the clockwise position (right) and KC_VOLD (Volume -) in the counter clockwise position (left).

NOTE: These position will not take any other key. If it does not see KC_VOLD & KC_VOLU it will not flip and stays the default logic.
